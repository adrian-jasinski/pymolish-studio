# 14 — Action and right-click menus

[Roadmap](../../PLAN.md) · Request 2026-11-14 · Draft; menu code was read,
nothing was changed or counted beyond the `grep` numbers below.

**The red squares are a rendering artifact, fixed in one line (14a, do it
early). The real cleanup (14b, 14c) waits until steps 12 and 13 have added
their rows, so the menus are audited once.**

## What exists

- **One source for every popup:** `modules/pymol/menu.py`, 1,854 lines, 129
  builder functions returning `[kind, label, command]` rows.
- **Three places show them:**

  | Place | Code |
  | --- | --- |
  | A / S / H / L / C buttons on a row | `MENUS` table, `modules/pmg_qt/object_panel.py:35` |
  | Right click on a row | the same five as submenus, `object_panel.py:566` |
  | Right click in the viewport | `pick_menu`, `main_menu` through `popup_at_cursor`, `object_panel.py:177` |

- **Red squares, the cause.** 26 destructive rows carry the color code `\933`
  (`del_col`, `rem_col`, `menu.py:25`). `fill_menu` (`object_panel.py:172`)
  tints the row's icon with that color when the label is in `icons.LABELS`,
  and otherwise draws a 12 px square of the color. "delete object",
  "delete group", "delete everything", "delete selections" and
  "remove waters" are not in `LABELS`, so they get a red square. They are not
  error markers. The same code correctly draws swatches in the color menus.
- **Duplicates and dead rows found so far:**

  | What | Where |
  | --- | --- |
  | `sele_action2`: 10 of its 16 rows are also in `sele_action`; one caller | `menu.py:1195`, `:1718` |
  | `group_action`: 17 of its 21 rows are also in `mol_action` | `menu.py:1221`, `:1252` |
  | `duplicate`, marked `# broken...` | `menu.py:1185` |
  | `clean`, raises until [step 13](13-structure-cleanup.md) | `mol_action`, `sele_action` |
  | `test1`, `test2` builders, no caller found in Python or C++ | `menu.py:1487`, `:1494` |
  | zoom, orient, center, origin at the top of every A menu and in the toolbar | by design: toolbar is global, menu is per object |

## Decisions

- **Keep `menu.py` and its function names.** Plugins wrap them (the pymolish
  plugin wraps `group_action`), and the C++ internal GUI reads the same lists.
  This step edits rows, it does not redesign the format.
- **Menu content is a user-facing change:** 14b produces the list, the user
  approves it, 14c applies it.

## Slices

**14a, red squares. Small, no dependency on other steps.**
- `icons.menu_icon`: fall back to the label's first word, so every
  "delete ..." and "remove ..." row gets the trash icon, tinted red.
  One line. Squares remain only where a row has a color and no icon: the
  color menus.
- Remove the broken `duplicate` row.
- Test: for every row built with `del_col` or `rem_col`, `menu_icon` returns
  an icon.
- Commit: `fix(ui): destructive menu rows show a red trash icon, not a square`.

**14b, audit. After steps 12 and 13.**
- A throwaway script calls every builder with a dummy name and prints
  menu, path, label, command. Not committed.
- From that table: rows with the same command in one menu, rows whose command
  raises `IncentiveOnlyException`, rows unused in the three places above.
- Output: one keep / merge / drop table in this file, for the user's approval.
  Also the before numbers: rows per menu, lines in `menu.py`.

**14c, apply.**
- One builder for selection actions (`sele_action2` becomes a flag); one for
  object and group actions.
- Target A menu, about 14 top rows:
  zoom, orient, center · rename, duplicate, delete · clean ▸ · preset ▸ ·
  find ▸ · align ▸ · hydrogens ▸ · group ▸ · more ▸ (origin, drag, reset
  matrix, generate, state, masking, sequence, movement, compute).
- Right click on a row: essentials flat on top (zoom, show as ▸, color ▸,
  rename, duplicate, delete), then the five submenus as today.
- Essentials added: a working `duplicate`, the group rows from
  [step 12](12-native-commands.md), the clean submenu from step 13. Anything
  else comes from the approved table, not from this draft.
- Delete `test1`, `test2` and every builder left without a caller
  (`grep -rn` across Python, C++, `data/`, tests first).
- Test: no menu has two rows with the same command; every command string in
  the object, group and selection menus parses.
- Report rows and `menu.py` lines before and after. Target: fewer of both.
- Commit: `simplify(ui): merge duplicated action menus`.

## Skipped

- Rewriting `menu.py` as data tables or native `QMenu` code.
- Icons for every row.
- The viewport's internal C++ menu drawing.
- New shortcuts for menu rows.
